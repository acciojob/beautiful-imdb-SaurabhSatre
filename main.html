            Two friends are searching for their long lost companion. They revisit their college days and recall the memories of their friend who inspired them to think differently, even as the rest of the world called them "idiots". A coming-of-age story about three engineering students at India's premier college who learn that success isn't about rote memorization or blind conformity, but about passion, innovation, and the courage to challenge conventional wisdom. The film combines hilarious comedy with touching emotional moments as it delivers powerful messages about education, friendship, and pursuing one's dreams.
